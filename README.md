Your safety = My safety
@TfLizard_Eth

Thank Satoshi for deploying Bitcoin before any other government could have "control" of our
financial freedom.

More than 12 years after I mined and bought my first Bitcoin, I would like to submit a security
solution to all the blockchains that have been created.

I note today that blockchain undergoes massive attacks "Wallet Cracker" for example via a list of
word auto-generate which make a conversion in sha256 and an automatic check of the wallets
massively hoping to unearth gems.

Let's take the example of Etherscan & Bscscan being based on the same type of explorer:
1. The crackers discover an address for which they have the private key
2. I find out the exact amount of the wallet, example: 10 Ethereum ($12217)
3. I take out the funds to transfer them to another address
4. Mixer and disappear

The security solution is simple, allow explorers to connect via metamask (so the chosen wallet) to
etherscan (for the example) and check the box: "Hide the amounts".
1. I connect to Etherscan with metamask
2. I go to the wallet configuration
3. I check the box to hide the amount in my wallet

By doing this, the various sites using etherscan's api will have to use the resources found on
etherscan, so if the user hides the wallet amount, it will be automatically hidden on the other sites.

Crackers looking for wallets containing amounts will not be able to know how much the address has
and will have to check everything manually, this brings a layer of security as the chance of having a
wallet with a large amount is quite low in view of the amount of possible combinations, this will
considerably reduce bruteforce attempts in view of the difficulties of knowing how much x wallet
has.

For the example, let's take the word, toto:
Toto Sha256: 31f7a65e315586ac198bd798b6629ce4903d0899476d5741a9f32e2e521b6a66
https://etherscan.io/address/0x5Fb374a5bEC027e808fa6e34Ceaf277d698FdbFE

By magic, the address is already used on the testnet goerli more than 500j ago on ethereum.
Being the owner of the wallet "toto" by connecting to the explorer via metamask I can check a
configuration box to hide the amount(s) of my wallet.

Now let's say your wallet doesn't have BNB or Eth, there are probably other tokens that your wallet
has value, the hidden functionality will simply set your balance to 0 or 1 for negative/positive which
means: Ethereum present, Ethereum not present. 
Displaying on the wallet the presence of token is enough instead of displaying the exact amount, the positive value for crackers will appear even if
your Ethereum amount is 0.0000001 which is worth nothing today.

This privacy and security solution for the blockchain will bring a second life that will allow a much
longer stability of OUR ecosystem.

User, government, developer, nobody will know anything about your content only if you want, a real
total decentralization.

This method is applicable for all blockchains whose developers have the capacity to implement this
functionality. I am able to develop this type of function, but it is not my job I only submit to the
blockchain universe a security layer.

This security solution is a security applicable by all existing blockchain today, users will automatically
redirect to the blockchain having a security layer in addition to decentralization.

The blockchain is a solution to be financially free, decentralized, "under our control" so why not put
in place a security solution by letting everyone choose to manage these funds in depth.
